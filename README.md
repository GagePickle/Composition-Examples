# Composition Examples

This project contains examples of creating objects through the use of `Composition`. There are `function factories` which return a method wrapped in an object, that can be added to as many classes and objects as needed. Also included are `Person` and `Animal` classes, with instances of each that demonstrate the methods `composed` into them.

`Composition` uses 'has a' relationships in order to design types. In contrast, `Inheritance` utilizes 'is a' relationships to design types.

Although `Inheritance` is a popular way of creating objects, it is flawed in that it forces you to plan ahead and create the functionality that you think you will need, instead of creating functionality that you currently need. This can easily result in overlooking something, in which case you have to backtrack and redo your code in order to add whatever you forgot.

Through the use of `Composition` you can add whatever functionality you like on the fly, to as many 'things' as you like. This allows you to not have to worry about the future as much, and instead focus on what you need to do in the current moment.
